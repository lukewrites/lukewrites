### Hi, I'm Luke 👋 

- 🔭 I’m currently working on Tableau's [Connector Plugin SDK](https://githubcom/tableau/connector-plugin-sdk/), which lets anyone connect their data to Tableau so they can see and understand data.
- ❤️ I love working with Python.
- 😄 Pronouns: he/him
- ⚡ Fun fact: I was a classroom teacher before becoming a full-time developer.
