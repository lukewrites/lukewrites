### Hi, I'm Luke 👋 

- 🔭 I work at Tableau Software, focusing on external and internal dev tools like the [Connector Plugin SDK](https://github.com/tableau/connector-plugin-sdk/), which lets anyone connect their data to Tableau so they can see and understand data.
- ❤️ I love working with Python.
- 😄 Pronouns: he/him
- 🥶 My code got sent to the Arctic and I didn't even pack it a sweater.
